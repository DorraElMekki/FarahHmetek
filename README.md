our Tunisian cuisine is a warm cuisine. It's the cuisine we love and share. It is in this context that we conceive our application. our application is called "Farrah Hmetek". We deliberately chose a typically Tunisian name that would mark anyone who hears it The application have three major parts : the first part: You can make a based-on-name search for a recipe from our gourmet database  the 2nd part: You can share your recipe with Farrah Hmetek's community. You must specify the name, type and the ingredients. Also don't forget to add a photo of your masterpiece. this part was added because 22.6% of respondents would like to share their culinary achievements.  we would like to gather as many passionate people as possible strengthen the culinary love we share.   THE 3rd part:  You can choose your ingredients (a based-on-ingredient search) and find the recipe that suits you according to what you have in your cupboards! 71.7% of the people we questioned waste their time looking for what to cook from what they have. Very relatable, isn't it? but worry no more. This part is for you!
